    <p>Hi! I'm Colin. I first learned how to code two years ago. When I started learning HTML and CSS in 2019, it was very casually. I was watching and following along with tutorials, but I wasn't building anything, let alone anything meaningful. I would commit to maybe one hour per day, inconsistently I might add, in between my shifts at my full-time job at a golf course. It wasn't until a year later (Summer 2020) that I started dedicating real time to practice.</p>
    
    <p>So I started watching Youtube videos by software developers, data scientists, and self-taught programmers. In November, I came across a website JobReadyProgrammer.com, which granted me access to two paths you could take towards starting a career in tech: Data Analyst and Software Developer. The instructor there said the lowest barrier of entry into tech would be the Data track (SQL and Tableau), so that's where I started.</p>
